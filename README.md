RASPI-BareMetal
===================

This rep is some of my work on the Raspberry pi Bare Metal (no OS). i had loads of help from both the person and the code written by David Welch (https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi). His examples are numerous, and you get a deep understanding of bare metal, the functionalities of toolchains, the way ARM processors work, etc. look it up. Some samples of code might come from the raspi baremetal forum (http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=72&sid=0559e601cec99cd3354a4a4d91424c76), but i didn't keep track of it at the time. If you find lines of code you think you've written, hit me up and we can work it out.

This is an old project, from when I started doing things on ARM processors (I used to work on 8051 mostly), therefor it is not always smartly written. As said in the MIT license present at the root of this repository, any code you will find in this rep is provided "as is" without any warranty. that said, the raspberry pi is supposed to be unbrickable, so you should be fine.

**ALL OF THIS WAS DONE ON THE RASPBERRY PI MODEL B.** I know since then the foundation has released other models wich look very promising, but they are not documented enough for me (at the moment, they just released the raspberry pi model 2, and neither the schematics or the MPU datasheet are available), and until they are, i wont be comming back.
